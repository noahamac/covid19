# COVID19 Data Block

 This COVID-19 Block consists of LookML models, pre-built dashboards, and explores, built off of data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), the New York Times, the COVID Tracking Project, Definitive Healthcare, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Italyâ€™s Dipartimento della Protezione Civile. The data that powers the block is currently only available in BigQuery and will work with any Looker instance with an existing BigQuery connection.


*Views that pull data from BQ Public Datasets program, details on the data can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/free-public-datasets-for-covid19):*

 - [nyt_data](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/nyt_data.view.lkml) Light modifications to the NYT dataset so that we can merge with other data sources
 - [covid_combined](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/covid_combined.view.lkml) Combines the JHU and NYT datasets, and houses core calculations at the State level (internationally) and the county level (US Only)
 - [covid_combined_pdts](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/covid_combined_pdts.view.lkml) Stores PDTs built off of covid_combined for calculations looking back in time or comparing aginst other geographies
 - [italy_province](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/italy_province.view.lkml) and [italy_region](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/italy_regions.view.lkml) Calculates COVID19 metrics based on the data provided by Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri - Dipartimento della Protezione Civil


*Views that pull data from datasets we've made available in BigQuery - the ETL for these has not been fully tested, and data should be treated with somewhat less certainty:*

  - [coving_tracking_project](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/covid_tracking_project.view.lkml) Pulls in data from the [COVID-19 Tracking project](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/covid-tracking-data/blob/master/data/states_daily_4pm_et.csv  ) and houses calculations on testing in the US
  - [policies_by_state](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/policies_by_state.view.lkml) Pulls in data from the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/starschema.covid/) on policies that states have implemented in response to COVID-19
  - [hospital_bed_summary](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/hospital_bed_summary.view.lkml) Pulls in data from [Definitive Healthcare](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0.csv) on average hospital bed availability for hospitals within the US

*Views that pull data from Mapping / Population tables we've created (based on Census + Wikipedia data):*

  - [country_region](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/country_region.view.lkml) Maps countries to global regions
  - [state_region](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/state_region.view.lkml) Maps states to global regions
  - [population_by_county_state_country](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/population_by_county_state_country.view.lkml) Calculated the total estimated population for each geographical region for US counties and International States
  - [italy_province_stats](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/italy_province_stats.view.lkml) Population estimates and Area by Italy Province
  - [italy_region_stats](/projects/covid/files/covid_block/italy_region_stats.view.lkml) Population estimates and Area by Italy Region

### What We're Reading
> Looking at the coronavirus data is like looking at funhouse mirrors. Everything is distorted in some direction or another; some things look much bigger than they really are, others much smaller. - Nate Silver, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1241064789738217473?s=20)

With that in mind, here are some of the articles that have informed our understanding around how to explore, present, and share COVID-19 data.
